# TFSOTP

TFS OTP (One Team Project) is the powershell script to automate the creation of new Projects, or Team, with the respective Team field!

This script is based on the code published by Martin Hinshelwood, from the blog http://nakedalm.com/blog/, originally [here](http://nakedalm.com/powershell-tfs-2013-api-1-get-tfscollection-and-tfs-services/) and [here](http://nakedalm.com/powershell-tfs-2013-api-2-adding-to-a-globallist/)

Tested on the TFS 2013!

The code have to be improved! Send a pull request... or if you want to suggest a new feature, create a Issue!

Thank!
